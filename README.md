  ## BDD

  This web application focuses on calculating the day a user was born and after that give the user his or her Akan name depending on tyhe gender the user inputs. My main focus began on the behaviours i wanted to see in my final application. Before i think about the programmatic elements, what should this application do? At it most basic, it will need to be able to take information from the user and calculate the information "behind the scenes" and output the day the user was born and consequently the Akan name depending on the gender of the user. I then generated the specifications which includes
      * behaviour that i'll need to write code to handle
      * a sample input to demonstrate the behaviour
      * expected output i would get when the code is working correctly
  I made a list of all behaviours but i stayed focused on one task at a time until i had the core functionality in place.
